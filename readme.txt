This plugin adds 2 columns to the admin plugin's page to show when each plugin was last updated and upgraded.

== Description ==

This plugin adds two columns to the plugin's page in WordPress's admin to show when each plugin was "Last Updated" by the developer and when the plugin was "Last Upgraded" on the site. The "Last Updated" column will also show "Plugin not found" OR "Plugin has been closed!" if the plugin isn't on the repo anymore or has been closed. 

The first time you load the plugins page, it may load very slowly if you have a lot of plugins due to many API calls made to WordPress.org in order to retrieve the last updated information. 

This plugin makes 1 API call for each plugin installed. This data is cached for 24 hours, unless you manually clear the cache clearing via Admin Menu > Plugins > Plugin Columns.


The idea for this plugin's functionality and the artwork was by [Karissa Skirmont](http://karissaskirmont.com "karissaskirmont.com")'s of [Profoundly Purple](http://profoundlypurple.com "profoundlypurple.com"). 
Plugin Developed by [Steven Kohlmeyer](http://stevenkohlmeyer.com "stevenkohlmeyer.com") with contributions by [Michael Preslar (http://drzimp.com "drzimp.com")].

== Installation ==

1. Install this plugin either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. If in a Multisite install, "Network Activate" to show on ALL sites in the install or only Activate individually on a per site basis.
3. That's it. You're ready to go clean up your plugin list of old or closed plugins!

== Screenshots ==

1. The plugins table has 2 columns on the right side labeled: Last Updated and Last Upgraded.
2. A page dedicated to clearing cache on the Last Updated Column.
3. Shows a WordPress MultiSite Network Plugin page with last updated / last upgraded columns.
